    "A feature of modern programming languages is an extensive library of *standard functions*. This means that we can make use of well-tested and optimised functions for performing common tasks rather than writing our own. This makes our programs shorter and of higher quality, and in most cases faster.\n",

    "Python has a large standard library. To organise it, most functionality is arranged into 'modules', with each module providing a range of related functions.

    "Search engines are a good way to find library functions, e.g. entering \"Is there a Python function to compute the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number\" into a search engine will take you to the function `cmath.tanh`. Try this link: http://bfy.tw/7aMc."
